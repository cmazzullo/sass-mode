# sass-mode

This mode is a lightweight mode for SAS meant as an alternative to
ESS-mode. Although it doesn't integrate with a SAS repl it provides
syntax highlighting, indentation, single-button compilation and
.lst-review, and doesn't destroy your window config with a million
ESS-style windows :).
